    "### Citation anonymization test\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we apply the \"citation anonymization\" test. Modern LLMs have been trained on a large variety of text inputs. This raises the risk that the LLM has seen the input citation in its training process and has ``memorized\" the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our anonymization test, we first ask an LLM to rewrite the citation text in a manner which anonymizes case names and citations. This ensures that the prompt has not been seen in training, and cases mentioned are unlikely to actually exist. We then use this modified prompt and use an LLM to identify the right **holding** as before."
